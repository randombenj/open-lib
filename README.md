#open-lib

> open-lib is in **very** early development!

**Explore projects, download and try them, give feedback and rate the project.**

Open-lib is a Project release platform. The main goal is to provide simple to set up binarys and / or a short and well written documentation how to use the project. Sometimes its frustrating if you first have to google how to compile an open source project for yourself and in the end you don't try the project because it is to difficult to set up. Thats a lose-lose situation for the user and the developer. So on open-lib you can expolre new projects, and host releases of your own projects and get and give feedback.
